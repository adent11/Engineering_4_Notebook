## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description

In this assignment I made a function that allows you to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder division. It takes three values as parameters, two numbers to do the operations with and a third value that determines which operation will be done on the other values. The spicy version added the ability to do factorials, which returns a list that includes the factorials of both numbers instead of just one number like the other operations.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but still had many valuable lessons. Since it has been a while since I have coded in Python, reference websites like <https://www.w3schools.com/python> are very helpful for remembering syntax and giving simple descriptions and examples of how different parts of Python work. I also learned that you can return a list from a function and access the different items using ``` functionName(parameters)[itemNumber] ```.
